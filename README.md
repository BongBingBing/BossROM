# BossROM


# Intro

BossROM is used in Minecraft and is used to create an area for bosses to be spawned using a designated currency. BossROM also has full customization compatability so different bosses, currencies, permissions, costs, etc... can be edited easily within the code. BossROM is an easy to use, plug and play alternative to having several players exploring vast distances to find bosses which can cause major lag within the server. BossROM also has an account feature where admins can make accounts for players and the program will track the progress of players.


# Details

BossROM is a complex data logging and boss spawning program that allows admins to make accounts for players and allows player to spawn any listed bosses at a currency cost which can be changed in the code. The program will keep track of player activity and will progressively increase the price of spawning bosses if an hour has not passed yet (i.e. one boss is 5 units, the next boss is 10 units, next boss 20 units until one hour has passed where the cost goes back to 5). This data is logged in the server files which prevents any corruption of server crashes and tampering of data from non-admin users. Every aspect of the program is also very customizable including the cost of boss summoning, the bosses to be spawned, the security measures for admins, how long for the cost of each player to reset, etc... 

# How To Use

To get one of these computers, you will need to run the /give command in game, much like the command block in minecraft. The command should look like this: "/give @p computercraft:computer_command". After the computer is placed, open the computer and run this command in the command prompt to load the code onto the computer: pastebin get wynPQSkB BossROM . This command will reach out to pastebin and copy the code from pastebin and save it as a file of name "BossROM" on the command computer. Type "BossROM" into the command prompt and press enter to start the program. Enjoy the ability to summon bosses at a cost in one place!
